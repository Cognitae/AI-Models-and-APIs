Model Configuration Guide
This guide provides instructions on how to customize the Modelfile.txt for altering the behavior of the AI model in our application. You can adjust various settings, such as the model type, generation parameters, and the system prompt, to tailor the model's responses according to your requirements.

Changing the Model
The FROM line specifies which model to use. You can change it to use different models supported by our API, such as mistral, llama2, or llama2-uncensored.

Example:
FROM mistral

Adjusting Parameters
Parameters allow you to control the behavior of the model's text generation. Currently, the file includes a temperature setting, which adjusts the creativity of the responses. You can add more parameters as needed.

Supported parameters include:

temperature: Controls creativity (0 to 1).
max_tokens: Sets the maximum length of the generated response.
top_p: Adjusts the nucleus sampling for diversity (0 to 1).
frequency_penalty: Reduces repetition of recently used words.
presence_penalty: Reduces repetition of already used phrases.
To add or adjust a parameter, use the PARAMETER keyword followed by the parameter name and its value.

Example:
PARAMETER max_tokens 256
PARAMETER top_p 0.8



Certainly! Below is a concise README template you can use to explain how to modify your Modelfile.txt to configure the model settings, including changing the model, adjusting parameters, and defining the system prompt. This README can be added to your GitHub repository to guide users on customizing the model file to suit their needs.

Adjusting Parameters
Parameters allow you to control the behavior of the model's text generation. Currently, the file includes a temperature setting, which adjusts the creativity of the responses. You can add more parameters as needed.

Supported parameters include:

temperature: Controls creativity (0 to 1).
max_tokens: Sets the maximum length of the generated response.
top_p: Adjusts the nucleus sampling for diversity (0 to 1).
frequency_penalty: Reduces repetition of recently used words.
presence_penalty: Reduces repetition of already used phrases.
To add or adjust a parameter, use the PARAMETER keyword followed by the parameter name and its value.

Example:

sql
Copy code
PARAMETER max_tokens 256
PARAMETER top_p 0.8
Defining the System Prompt
The system prompt allows you to set a predefined context or persona that the model will use to generate responses. This is defined within the triple quotes (""") following the SYSTEM keyword.

To modify the system prompt, replace the placeholder text with your custom instructions or persona description.

Example:
SYSTEM """
You are speaking to an AI trained in classical music history. Feel free to ask anything about composers, eras, and famous works.
"""


Full Configuration Example
Hereâ€™s how a complete Modelfile.txt might look after customization:

FROM mistral
PARAMETER temperature 0.7
PARAMETER max_tokens 200
PARAMETER top_p 0.9
SYSTEM """
You are speaking to an AI assistant designed to provide cooking advice. Ask me any culinary question!
